To-Do List Application ✅

This is a simple and user-friendly to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. 
This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic state management while creating an interactive and responsive web interface.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
